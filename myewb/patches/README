The pinax base requires patching in some cases. Here are known problems
and fixes.


USING Pinax-0.7.1
Two files in 0.7.1 must be patched. See the generic instructions or simply
use the patch in this folder
ex:

$ cd $WORKON_HOME/pinax-env/lib/python2.6/site-packages/
$ patch -p0 --dry-run < $MYEWB_HOME/patches/pinax-0.7.1.patch
# if all goes according to plan
$ patch -p0 < $MYEWB_HOME/patches/pinax-0.7.1.patch
